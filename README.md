# Cat_Milk_Broom-Game
Cat-Milk-Broom is the English version of a game called Billi-Danda-Doodh. I saw some kids playing this game and found it interesting. It is based on the very popular game "Stone, Paper, Scissors." One plays this with one of his or her friends. Now is the time to choose your computer as your best friend. This is not so popular, but I hope you'll enjoy it.

So go ahead and have fun with it. 

**About Project:**  It has been implemented using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
